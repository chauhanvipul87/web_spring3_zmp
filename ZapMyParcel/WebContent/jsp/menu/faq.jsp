<strong>Can I send glass and ceramics?  </strong><br>
We can ship your glass and ceramic items; however they will not be insured against damage or loss regardless of how well the item is packaged.  <br><br>

<strong>What happens when there is no one to receive the delivery?  </strong><br>
The specified carrier undertakes to deliver to an address specified in the despatch documentation, not to a specific person. If there is no-one present at the address then the carrier will either attempt delivery to a neighbour or return the item to the delivery depot. If this occurs, a customer contact card shall be left at the specified address telling the recipient where to collect their parcel or to re-arrange another delivery time.  <br><br>

<strong>How can I monitor the status of my package through its delivery journey?  </strong><br>
Your shipment will be issued with a unique tracking number. This is issued to you upon order completion. So long as you print out your document and attach it to your shipment your driver will be provide a receipt and start the tracking process. You will have a SMS, phone or email alerted on delivery (if you enter your mobile number) and you can track it at any time via the ZapMy Parcel home page.  <br><br>


  <strong>Packaging</strong>
  <ul class="list">
    <li>When sending  goods all parcels must be correctly and safely packaged ensuring that any  delicate goods are fully protected in bubble wrap or soft packaging.</li> 
    <li>We sell  these boxing requirements if you do not have these on hand</li>
    <li>Suitcases  are OK to send as long as they are well labelled (addressed).</li>
    <li>Please see  our website for list of dangerous or prohibited exports which will not be  transported by Zap my parcel.</li>
    <li>Please note  that it is very important that all the information that you have given is  accurate – all parcels are digitally scanned and weighted at the sorting Depot.</li>
    <li>Incorrectly  labelled or packaged parcels may be returned by the courier without being  shipped. Parcels that exceed the maximum deliverable weight for a given country  and cannot therefore be delivered will be returned to you and a surcharge of  £15.00 will be levied.</li>

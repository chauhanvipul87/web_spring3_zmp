<p>When importing a parcel there are a few things to remember such as Custom regulations and duty tax.For more on this please look at our <a href="#">Terms & Conditions</a> page. </p>


<p>Importing a parcel into the United Kingdom is generally as straight forward as sending one, however now and then it may be complicated due to the contents of the parcel, for this reason we suggest you have a look at the HMRC website <a href="www.hmrc.gov.uk">www.hmrc.gov.uk</a> to make sure your parcel is ok for importing.</p>

<p>If we receive a parcel from overseas addressed to you, we will pay any relevant import duty, excise duty and VAT on your behalf to HM Revenue and Customs. Before the parcel can be released to you, we require you to repay this sum, together with our own clearance fee, details of which will be sent to you in a letter. To make things easier, payments options will be available to you when notification that your parcel has arrived is given. You can then also select how and when you would like the parcel delivered.</p>

<p>For goods moving within the EU, import duties and taxes do not usually apply. 
However, for goods imported from non-EU countries, Customs charges do apply, these may include import duty, excise duty and import VAT. </p>
<p>Goods with a value exceeding £15, for commercial items including internet/mail order purchases, or £40 in the case of gifts between private individuals, are generally subject to Customs charges.Normally charges are calculated upon the declared value, please note this is subject to change and that Zap My Parcel is only supplying a guide to importing taxes and cannot be held accountable for any changes or charges made by the United Kingdom government.</p>


<p>Please be sure to check for any changes or updates in <a href="www.hmrc.gov.uk">www.hmrc.gov.uk</a></p>

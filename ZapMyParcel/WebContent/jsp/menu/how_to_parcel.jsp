       <h5>How to Correctly Pack Your Parcel</h5>
       <div class="mo_container">

<h3>Packaging Guidelines</h3>

When packing your parcel it is important to pack it correctly so it can arrive safely
As the sender, you are the only person who knows exactly what is inside your parcel. Therefore, it is your responsibility to ensure your item is packaged correctly and does not contain illegal or hazardous goods.<br>
Zap My Parcel accepts no responsibility as to how your parcel is packed; it falls on the parcels sender to take the right steps to package the parcel correctly and to fully disclose what is inside the parcel.<br><br>

<h3>Internal Packaging</h3>
Internal packaging is one of the two key factors to getting your parcel there safely. There are several things you can use to properly pack the inside of your parcel these are our recommended products:<br>
<ul>
<li>Bubble Wrap</li>
<li>Polychips</li>
<li>Corrugated cardboard</li>
<li>Shredded or rolled paper</li>
<li>Polyethylene foam sheeting</li>
</ul>
When wrapping with bubble wrap the best idea is to keep wrapping till the item no longer has its original shape you may also want to place polychips or corrugated cardboard in there also. If you have more than one thing the best thing to do is wrap separately so the items cannot damage each other.<br><br>


<h3>How to Package Special Items</h3>
<strong>Bicycles</strong><br>
Remove pedals, handlebars and front wheel and pack with the remaining parts in a carton like those used by bicycle manufacturers. These cartons are generally available at bicycle shops.<br>
<em>Note: Parcels must still meet the volumetric weight limits.</em><br><br>


<strong>Small breakable items</strong><br>
Wrap individual objects with sufficient cushioning material so you cannot feel the shape of the object through the wrapping. Items packed together in one container should be individually wrapped and separated with cushioning material. Pack in a strong, rigid outer carton of cardboard. To help prevent movement of the items during delivery, ensure all gaps are filled.<br><br>


<strong>Electrical Equipment and Radios (including Toys, Computers and Games)</strong><br>

Pack in a strong, rigid cardboard carton. Keep parts well away from the side of the container by protecting them with adequate internal packaging. All computer parts must be packages in non-static internal packaging. All batteries must be removed from the item before sending to prevent it from activating during delivery.<br>
<em>Note: Some batteries are dangerous and cannot be couriered even when removed from the item. See our Prohibited Items Guide.</em>
<br>
<br>

<strong>Fishing Rods, Umbrellas, and things that a thin and long</strong><br>
Pack between two strong strips of wood or double wall cardboard slightly larger in length and width than the object. Wrap securely. HandiTubes or other strong cardboard tubes could also be used.<br>

<em>Note: Ensure the parcel does not exceed the maximum length dimension for the service being used.
</em>
<br><br>

<strong>Liquids</strong><br>

Ensure the item is not prohibited or hazardous (refer to our Prohibited Items Guide). Wrap bottles individually, surround with resilient cushioning material and place in a well sealed polyethylene bag. Pack in a strong cardboard carton with sufficient absorbent material such as newspaper or wood-shavings to soak up any possible spillage.<br><br>

<strong>Millinery</strong><br>
Pack in a strong cardboard carton. Surround the articles with internal cushioning to prevent movement.
<br><br>


<strong>Musical Instruments</strong><br>
Cases supplied with many musical instruments are not designed for protection during delivery. The existing case should be packed in double wall cardboard carton or a wooden case. Inner packaging must be used to stop movement of the instrument in its case and of the case within the outer carton.<br>
The bridges of stringed instruments should be removed and packed separately.<br><br>


<strong>Pictures in Frames</strong><br>
Completely cover glass with adhesive tape that can be easily removed. This will help to prevent the picture from being scratched, should the glass break.<br>
Wrap the frame at least twice in bubble wrap or polyethylene foam sheeting, taking care to use sufficient padding to protect the edges. Protective cardboard corners should be placed over the bubble wrap or foam. Place the picture between two sheets of solid cardboard or heavy weight corrugated cardboard and wrap in strong paper, or alternatively, pack in a strong cardboard carton with sufficient inner packaging to prevent movement.<br><br>


<strong>Powders</strong><br>
Ensure the item is not prohibited or hazardous (refer to our Prohibited Items Guide). Enclose dry powders in an airtight plastic container or tin and seal in a polyethylene bag. Pack in a strong cardboard carton with sufficient inner packaging to prevent movement.<br><br>


<strong>Sharp Instruments</strong><br>
Place a protective covering or guard over the edges or points to prevent them causing damage to other articles, or injuring anyone handling the parcel. Pack in a strong cardboard carton with sufficient inner packaging to prevent movement.<br><br>
 
<strong>External Packaging</strong><br>
Cardboard cartons are generally strong enough to ship material of average weight and size. Obviously the strength of the carton required will depend on what you are sending. Wooden crates may be necessary for particularly heavy items.

              <p>Unless any special services are agreed, the service to be provided by the Company is limited to the pickup, transportation and delivery of the Parcel, but also includes alert messaging and track and trace information to notify Customers of their Parcel movements; </p>
              <p>The Company is not a common carrier, will accept goods for carriage only on these conditions and reserves the right in its absolute discretion to refuse carriage of any package tendered to it for transportation; </p>
              <p>Parcels must not weigh more than 10kilograms nor exceed dimensions of 30 centimetres x 30 centimetres x 50 centimetres and must have a Label attached;

              <p>Subject to express written instructions given by the Customer, the Company reserves to itself absolute discretion as to the means, route and procedure to be followed in the handling, storage and transportation of the Parcel. If in the opinion of the Company it is at any stage necessary or desirable in the Customer's interest to depart from those instructions the Company shall be at liberty to do so. </p>
            </li>
            <li><strong> Items not carried </strong>
              <p> The Company shall not be required or caused to carry or convey anything if such carriage or conveyance would be unlawful. The Company will not carry gases, pyrotechnics, arms and ammunition or corrosive, toxic, flammable, explosive, oxidising or radioactive materials or any other noxious, dangerous or hazardous goods or goods likely to cause damage. Should the Customer or the Consignor nevertheless deliver any such goods in a Parcel to the Company or cause the Company to handle or deal with any such goods, the Customer shall be liable for any and all loss or damage caused by, or in connection with the goods however arising and shall indemnify the Company against all penalties, claims, damages, costs and expenses whatsoever arising in connection therewith and the goods may be destroyed or otherwise dealt with at the sole discretion of the Company or by any other person in whose custody they may be at the relevant time; </p>

Should any Customer or Consignor nevertheless (whether knowingly or unknowingly) deliver such goods in a Parcel to the Company or cause the Company to handle such goods otherwise than under special arrangements previously made in writing, the Company shall be under no liability whatsoever in connection with the goods however arising. </p>
              <p>The Company reserves the right to refuse any Parcels which are neither the property of, nor sent on behalf of, the Customer.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong> Company's obligation </strong>
              <p>In consideration of the payments to be made to the Company by the Customer, the Company shall carry out the services described in the Scope of Service</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Liability of the Company </strong>
              <ol>
                <li>The Company shall only be responsible for any loss or damage to a Parcel for non-delivery or mis-delivery if it is proved that the loss, damage, non-delivery or mis-delivery was due to the negligence or default of the Company or its agents; </li>
                <li>The Company shall only be liable for non-compliance with instructions if it is proved that the same was caused by the negligence or default of the Company or its agents; </li>
                <li>It shall be the responsibility of the Customer to satisfy itself that any Parcel that it wishes to have carried by the Company, shall meet the weight and dimensions conditions stated in the scope of service. The Company will accept no liability whatsoever for any loss or damage to such Parcel arising from the unsuitability of such Parcel; </li>
                <li>Without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, the Company can under no circumstances whatsoever, accept any responsibility for any delay to Parcels not due to the negligence or default of the Company or its agents; </li>
                <li>Further and without prejudice to the generality of the proceeding sub condition, the Company shall, whether under sub conditions (i) or (ii) or otherwise, accept no liability whatsoever for any detention of Parcels or for any consequential loss, damage or deterioration, except where (a) the Customer shall have specified to the Company the nature of the goods in the Parcel and purpose of their transit, and the Company through its General Manger shall have agreed in writing with the Customer a time schedule and specification in respect of the transit of the said Parcel and (b) it shall be proved that such detention delay, loss, damage or deterioration was due to the negligence of the Company; </li>
                <li>Since the Company is unable to assess the cost to a Customer of the loss or damage of any Parcel, in no case whatsoever shall any liability of the Company, however arising and notwithstanding any lack of explanation, exceed the cost value of the relevant goods in a Parcel or £40 whichever is less. If the goods in the Parcel have any extra intrinsic value to the Customer or the Customer would suffer consequential losses in the event of their loss or damage to the goods in the Parcel, then the Customer is advised to insure against such risks and losses since the Company is unable to warrant that its own insurance will be applicable to such loss or damage or (if applicable) will extend to cover any sums claimed; </li>
                <li>The Company shall not be liable for loss or damage to any part of any Parcel (whether comprising one or more packages in the Parcel), or for the loss or non-delivery of the whole of any Parcel, or for damage, delay or detention or any part thereof however caused, unless the Company is advised thereof in writing, of the fact of the loss or damage or mis-delivery (as the case may be) within 7 days of the loss damage or mis-delivery occurring and a quantified claim is made in writing within 28 days of the occurrence. </li>
                <li>The Company shall not be liable for loss or damage to any part of any Parcel (whether comprising one or more packages in the Parcel), or for the loss or non-delivery of the whole of any Parcel, or for damage, delay or detention or any part thereof however caused, if the parcel is not correctly labelled with a valid Urban Drop label. </li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li><strong> Customer's obligation </strong>
              <p>Customers entering into transactions of any kind with the Company for carriage of the goods in the Parcels expressly warrant that they are either owners or the authorised agent of the owners of any goods in the Parcels to which the transaction relates and further warrant that they are authorised to accept and are accepting these conditions not only for themselves but also as agents for and on behalf of all other persons who are or may thereafter become interested in the goods in the Parcels;</p>
              <p>The Company insists that all goods entrusted to the Company for carriage have been properly Labelled with a Urban Drop label purchased from the Company, or provided by a client of the Company, and prepared for carriage; </p>
              <p>Customers are required to have Consignees collect Parcels from the relevant delivery point within 10 days of their being notified of the Parcel being available for collection. If the Parcel is not collected within 10 days, the Company reserves the right to either return the Parcel to the Customer or dispose of the Parcel as the Company reasonably sees fit. If the Parcel is returned to the Customer an additional charge will be made to the Customer. </p>
              <p>Parcel Labels must be used within 30 days of purchase. After 30 days the Labels will expire and the price paid will not be refunded. </p>
            </li>
            <li> <strong>Variation</strong>
              <p>No variation, extension or cancellation of these terms shall be binding upon the Company unless and until it is confirmed in writing under the hand of a Director of the Company and, for the avoidance of doubt, it is declared that no person other than such Director has authority to negotiate or enter into any commitment on behalf of the Company the effect of which would or might (but for this present clause) involve the Company in any legal liability whatsoever. </p>
            </li>
            <li><strong> Applicable Law </strong>
              <p>These terms shall be construed in accordance with the laws of England and the Courts of England shall have exclusive jurisdiction in relation to any matters arising out of a contract incorporating these Terms. </p>
            </li>
            <li><strong> Third Parties </strong>
              <p>A person who is not a party to these terms shall have no right to enforce any term of these terms under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999.</p>

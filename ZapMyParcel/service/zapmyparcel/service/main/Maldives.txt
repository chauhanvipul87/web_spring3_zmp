        <h5>About Maldives</h5>
        <div class="mo_container">
          <p>The Maldives are a cluster of 26 atolls (coral islands) located in the Indian Ocean, approximately 250 miles off the South-West of India and 430 miles from the coast in India.</p>
          <p>In 1989 the Maldivian government commenced a program of economic reform, by implementing measures such as allowing more foreign investments, imports and exports. Today, the Maldives primary industry sector is tourism, followed by fishing. Currently, import duties and tourism related taxes actually account for more than 90% of governments total tax revenue.</p>
          <p>If you need to send a business consignment package to the Maldives, or a small personal item, then Urban Drop will find you the best parcel delivery option available. We will compare the world's leading courier companies, such as DHL, UPS and Parcel Force, to source you the fastest and most convenient delivery option, while saving you the time and hassle of trawling through the individual websites yourself. Urban Drop will then oversee the whole delivery process from door to door.</p>
          <p>From the UK your mail will have to travel over 5000 miles to the Maldives, most likely by a combination of land, air and sea transport. You should therefore package your items appropriately and surround any breakable goods with padding, such as bubble wrap or polystyrene. You should clearly label your parcel and include a return address on the rear. Because you will be sending mail out with the European Union's customs territory, you will need to fill out and attach a customs declaration form to the front of your parcel. Some items are actually forbidden from being couriered internationally, e.g. flammable materials, aerosols and explosives, therefore, you should read the following prohibited items list carefully before posting your goods.</p>
          <p>The Maldives Post is the national postal service used throughout the islands; it was introduced in 1906 and by 1994 every inhabited island was home to a post office. Although reliable, national postal services have been known to misplace or delay some mail items. If you chose Urban Drop to organise the delivery of your goods, you can rest assured that they will be safely delivered, on schedule.</p>
          <p>If you have a strict delivery timeline for your parcel then it is recommended that you take into account any public holidays, both of the UK and the Maldives, as they may result in an extra day on the delivery schedule. The Maldives enjoy holidays such as "Mawlid al-Nabi" (Birth of the Prophet) on the 4th February, "The Day Maldives Embraced Islam" on 29th March and "Eid al-Adha" (Feast of the Sacrifice) on 26th October, to name a few.</p>

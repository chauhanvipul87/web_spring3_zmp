        <h5>About New Zealand</h5>
        <div class="mo_container">
          <p>New Zealand, also known as "the land of the long white cloud", is around 11,600 miles from the UK, and is inhabited mainly by European descendants. New Zealand was one of the final significant land-masses to be discovered and settled by humans. In 1842 New Zealand became classified as a colony of the British Empire after Maori chiefs signed the Treaty of Waitangi. This resulted in an increased number of immigrants moving to New Zealand, from all over the world.</p>
          <p>New Zealand is well known for its wild and mountainous landscapes, volcanic features, scenic beaches, lakes and glaciers, and is one of the most unpopulated countries on earth. It's situated about 900 miles off the coast of Australia, in the South-West Pacific Ocean. The islands remoteness has led, over time, to a unique variety of plant and animal life, such as its national treasure: the flightless Kiwi bird. New Zealand made up of 2 main islands, the North Island and the South Island, separated by the Cook Straight.</p>
